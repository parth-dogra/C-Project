# **Personal Expense Tracker (Budget Manager)**

A console-based C application to record, manage, and analyze daily expenses using dynamic memory allocation and file handling.

## **About the Project**

This project helps users track their daily expenses with details like **date, category, amount, and notes**.
It uses **C programming fundamentals** such as:

* Structures
* Dynamic memory allocation
* File handling
* Modular functions
* String handling
* Menu-driven interaction

The program stores data permanently and loads it on startup, acting as a simple personal budgeting tool.

## **Technologies & Concepts Used**

* C language
* Structures
* Pointers
* Arrays & Strings
* Dynamic memory (`malloc`, `realloc`, `free`)
* File handling (`fopen`, fprintf, fscanf, fclose`)
* Modular programming
* Error handling
